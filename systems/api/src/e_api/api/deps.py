"""api.deps: chained dependency providers — litestar resolves the graph recursively per request.

No FastAPI `Depends()` sugar: binding is by *name*. Each link declares what it consumes in its own
signature (`oauth` and `store` take `graph`, `current_user` takes `request` + `store`), every route
wires the chains it uses in a local `dependencies` mapping, and the app itself registers nothing.
Links run once per request, in resolved order; independent links run concurrently.
