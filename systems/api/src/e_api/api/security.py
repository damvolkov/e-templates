"""api.security: bearer enforcement and the OpenAPI contract — `core.crypto` is the only source of truth.

The guard verifies the token and parks its claims in the connection scope; `provide_current_user`
(api.deps) turns those claims into a `User`. Guards run before dependencies, so a handler that
depends on `current_user` is automatically behind the bearer check once `auth_guard` is attached.
