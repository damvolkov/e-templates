"""api.lifespan.core: the one-time load of the shared core singletons, mirrored as a typed graph section.

`settings` and `logger` are `LazyProxy`s in the materialized core: nothing loads at import, the first
attribute access pays for the load exactly once per process. This lifespan *is* that first access —
the rest of the chain may then reach `st` and `logger` through a plain global import with zero startup
cost — and it deposits the loaded pair under `state.core` for consumers that prefer the graph.
Both roads reach the same singleton: the section is the same object the module-level proxy names."""

    design in core (dynamic composition), so a fancier wrapper could not add static strength anyway.
